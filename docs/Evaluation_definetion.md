# Evaluation definition

We measure the quality of the response by the following 7 metrics. We provide the definition of each metric and the corresponding strategies, guidances and examples.

| Strategies                            | Guidances                                                    | Examples                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Information                           | The response should supply  psychological, counselling or mental health data, facts, resources, theory,  etc.. It may be specifically related to the counseling process and client's  behavior. It may answer direct questions but does not include directions for  what the client should do. | There is a psychological effect  on first     love, called Zeigarnic effect. |
| Direct  Guidance                      | The response should provide  suggestions, directives, instructions, or advice about what the client should  do to change. This consists of directions or advice that the counselor  suggests for the client, or for the client and counselor together, either within  or outside the counseling session. | To cope with your OCD, plan  ahead by discussing your concerns with your husband and setting boundaries. |
| Approval and Reassurance              | The response should provide  emotional support, reassurance, encouragement, approval, or reinforcement. It  may imply sympathy or tend to alleviate anxiety by minimizing client's  problems. | Let me give you a warm hug! /  It's wonderful to hear that you are feeling better and finding the diary and  thought tables beneficial. |
| Restatement & Reflection  & Listening | The response should show its  understanding on what the client is feeling or what the client's message  means. Then the response should provide repeating or rephrasing of the  client's statement(s), or meaning of the question, put its understanding into  one's own words (code) and feed it back for the clientâ€™s verification. It  must contain reference to stated or implied feelings. It may be based on  previous statements, or knowledge of the total situation. It may be phrased  either tentatively or as a statement. | You feel like you are becoming  violent. / It seems like you are struggling with finding a balance in your  relationships, especially when it comes to having deep, personal  connections. |
| Interpretation                        | The response should go beyond  what the client has overtly recognized. It might take one of several forms:  It might establish connections between seemingly isolated statements or  events; it interprets defenses, feelings, resistance, or transference (the interpersonal  relationship between counselor and client): it might indicate themes,  patterns, or causal relationships in the client's behavior or personality. It  usually gives alternative meanings, reasons or explanations for old behavior  or issues. | I think you love your mom very  much.                        |
| Self-disclosure                       | The response should share the  psychiatrist's own personal experiences and feelings with the client; may  begin with an "I". Note that not all statements that begin with an  "I" are self-disclosure; it must have a quality of sharing or disclosing. | This question brings back to me  some similar memories       |
| Obtain  releveant information         | The response should use  appropriate questions. It may request a clarification of feelings or an  exploration of the situation without purposely limiting the nature of the  response to a yes or no or a one- or two-word response. | Can you provide an example of a  change you are considering and why it is challenging for you? |
