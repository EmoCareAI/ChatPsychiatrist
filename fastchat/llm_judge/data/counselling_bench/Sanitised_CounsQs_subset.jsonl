Recently, I suspect that I may not trust her enough because of certain factors, including her training, appearance, etc., and I did not get a positive response from her after I had the courage to bring it up to her. At one point I suspected that she was not handling her self-exposure well and didn't dare to bring it up to her directly for fear that she would be sad.

{"question_id": 223, "turns": ["I have a very close friend. She was left with severe separation anxiety from her childhood, resulting in severe clinginess, lack of confidence, and needing me to keep tabs on her status. She even asks to share a bed with me and touch each other's bodies when we are both same-sex adults and have no homosexual tendencies. Personally, I am avoidant, so I felt stifled and uncomfortable. But whenever I objected to this, she would be extremely sad and unable to communicate. And this definitely gave her a second injury. I feel guilty, but I still don't think I should feel free to ignore my feelings. Now I am in complete conflict with her basic demands - she needs my attention and I want to have enough personal space.

I would like to help her reconcile with herself if I can, but if not, I would at least like to exit the relationship without causing her any harm"], "category": "generic"}

She often criticizes me with selfishness, saying that she shouldn't live in the world and that we should live separately and so on. She would also yell and cry, and could even cry three or four times a day. If I strongly resisted, she would do things like slamming doors and slapping herself.

Small dogs and cats that people on the other side like, but I feel that they may be aggressive to me. Especially puppies. I have been afraid of dogs since I was a child.
