Firstly, it is important to recognize that your parents are the ultimate decision makers and that they will always put your best interests first. You can talk to your parents about how you feel and how you think their family should be respected equally. Additionally, you should try to have empathy for your mother and father and recognize that they may have good intentions even if their actions do not line up with those intentions.
